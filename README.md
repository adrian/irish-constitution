## The Irish Constitution

This repository records the evolution of the Irish Constitution from its inception up to and including amendment thirty-three.

The [commit history](https://github.com/adrian/irish-constitution/commits/master/constitution.md) of constitution.md records the effect of each amendment.

For the sake of completeness I've included the transitory articles 51 to 64 and 34a.

I didn't include sub-sections 3, 4, or 5 of article 29 section 7 as the details are already recorded in articles 2, 3, and 29.8.
